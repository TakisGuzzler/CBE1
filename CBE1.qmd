# Methods:
You should clearly explain which methods you chose and why.


# Results:
The results should begin with descriptive analysis or EDA (exploratory data analysis) before moving on to other kinds of analysis/modeling. Be sure your visualizations are well-designed and properly captioned. Also, be sure to follow the appropriate conventions for reporting your statistical results as outlined in Brezina.

# Discussion:
What conclusions might you draw from your findings? Do they suggest interesting directions for further study? If your CBE didnâ€™t work out the way you had hoped/expected, do you have any intuitions as to why? What are the limitations of your study and approach?
