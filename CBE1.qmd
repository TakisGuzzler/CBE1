# Introduction:
- Comparison of presidential debates and how they have changed over the past decade
- Changes over time for parties, incumbents, moderators, etc.
- Types of words used, amount of words spoken, other differences

# Data:
- First presidential debates for Obama vs Romney and Harris vs Trump
- Obtained transcripts online and split them by who was speaking
- 3 groups for each transcript: Democrat, Republican, and Moderator

# Methods:
You should clearly explain which methods you chose and why.

# Results:
The results should begin with descriptive analysis or EDA (exploratory data analysis) before moving on to other kinds of analysis/modeling. Be sure your visualizations are well-designed and properly captioned. Also, be sure to follow the appropriate conventions for reporting your statistical results as outlined in Brezina.

# Discussion:
What conclusions might you draw from your findings? Do they suggest interesting directions for further study? If your CBE didnâ€™t work out the way you had hoped/expected, do you have any intuitions as to why? What are the limitations of your study and approach?
